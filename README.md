## Program lego robot to traverse the maze in simulated environment and test it in the actual maze

The leJOS mindstorm robot had inbuilt Color, Ultrasonic and Gyro sensor installed. Using these sensors the robot had to traverse the maze avoiding collisions with the walls of the maze. For the final task, the robot had to identify a coloured wall in the maze. Given that the coloured wall existed only in the three sided corner in the maze. The user had the freedom to choose the coloured wall, so the robot had the menu option of colours in the robot's display to choose. Once the color was decided the robot was placed in the maze and it starts to traverse the maze looking for a three sided wall and then detect the desired colored wall.
